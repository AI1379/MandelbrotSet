# Mandelbrot Set

This is a simple implementation of the Mandelbrot set in C++ with OpenCV. Just for fun.

It was inspired by the math soft course on the semester 2025/1 at ZJU.

## Build Pre-requisites

Currently, this project is only tested on Windows. However, I believe it should work on Linux as well.

### Windows

- CMake
- OpenCV
- MSVC (Clang and GCC should work as well, but I haven't tested it)
- google test (optional)
